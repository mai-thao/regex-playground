Regular expression, or [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) for short, is a pattern-matching language that can search, extract, or manipulate text.

This repo houses example regex problems, solutions, and explanations (if needed for complex ones).

### Common Notations
Here are some common notations and their meaning:
* `.` matches any single character
* `*` matches 0 or more repetitions
* `+` matches 1+ repetitions
* `?` makes the preceding token optional
* `[]` matches any character inside the brackets
* `^` matches the start of a line
* `$` matches the end of a line
* `()` groups patterns
* `\` escapes special characters or gives special meaning (e.g. `\d` to denote digits)
